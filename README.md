## Description
Film Tracker is a web application designed for film enthusiasts to keep track of movies theyâ€™ve watched and movies they plan to watch. Using the OMDb API to fetch movie details, users can search for a film by title and view key information like the director, cast, genre, and plot. The app allows users to add films to a "Watch List" or a "Seen It" list, with all selections saved in localStorage for easy access across sessions.
